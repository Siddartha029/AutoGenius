            <h2>About AutoGenius</h2>
            <p>AutoGenius is a vehicle comparison tool designed to help you make informed decisions about your next car purchase. We provide a simple and intuitive way to compare the specifications of different vehicles side-by-side.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>AutoGenius uses a comprehensive database of vehicle specifications. Simply enter the names of the two vehicles you want to compare, and we'll provide you with a detailed breakdown of their specs.</p>
